# GameSafe

## Description
GameSafe is a full CRUD website designed to save users game libraries. The site uses an external third-party API to retrieve thousands of games from PC to Xbox to even mobile games. This app allows the user to create a profile for themselves and add games to their profile. They can add games to their wishlist if they so choose to. Every game has its own page with all sorts of information about said game.
